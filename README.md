# Newa Api Implementation with Flutter

I have created the application according the rules provided by you.

1. I have stored apikey in environment variables and not hardcoded it using __dotenv__.
2. I have implemented search and filtering for both everything api and top-headlines api
3. I have added bookmark section where users can store their favourite story in bookmark section. I have used __sharedPreferences__ for storage purposes.
4. I have implemented the __webview__ so that users can open the actual article inside the app itself.
5. I have used __provider state management__.
6. **Error handling** is done swiftly and in user-friendly way
